We have tried to clone website named JioMart a online shopping website so we as a team decided to clone as many page as we can in the given time and we end up cloning more than 6 pages, which was really exciting for us as we all were cloning a website for the very first time. And this is how our landing page looks

In this project we have   tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible. This entire journey of this construct week has given us experiences and we have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Most of the features are added and functionality of the website is achieved.
